###Updates
---
This particular project is scheduled for multiple small updates between the dates of 3-13-21 and 3-20-21
as prescribed by the strict edicts of merciless code-reviewers.

###Description
---
A brief recommendation for a bike trip across the northern US and overview of major sights to visit along the way.  Some notable
examples are Erie Pennsylvania and the entire state of Ohio.  Strangely, the western states are not included, but rest assured there
are many sights to see in Montana and the Dakotas even if they are not included in this overview. This website is designed to be 
compatible across multiple devices with varying dimensions so one can plan the trip from their at-home computer and then check in
along the way from their mobile device.

The website features the use of grid, flex, and multiple simple hover animations.
